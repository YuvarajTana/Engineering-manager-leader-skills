The **SIRCA model** is a structured feedback framework designed to make feedback **constructive**, **actionable**, and **growth-oriented**, especially in professional environments like engineering teams. It stands for:

## üß© **SIRCA Feedback Model Breakdown**

| Letter | Stands for       | Purpose                                                                        |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **S**  | **Situation**    | Describe the context in which the behavior occurred.                           |
| **I**  | **Impact**       | Explain the effect the behavior had on the team/project/person.                |
| **R**  | **Reaction**     | Share your personal response or how others perceived it.                       |
| **C**  | **Consequences** | Outline the short- or long-term outcomes if the behavior continues or changes. |
| **A**  | **Action**       | Suggest a clear, actionable next step or improvement.                          |

## üìå Example (Peer-to-Peer Feedback)

> **S**: In our sprint planning meeting last Friday...
> **I**: You interrupted multiple times, which disrupted the flow of the discussion.
> **R**: I felt that others were discouraged from sharing their ideas.
> **C**: If this continues, team collaboration might suffer.
> **A**: Next time, try noting down your thoughts and waiting until the current speaker finishes before jumping in.

## üí° Use Cases for Engineering Managers

### üîÑ 1. **Code Review Feedback**

> "In your last PR (S), there were no tests written (I). It made QA spend extra time validating edge cases (R). This delays deployments (C). Please ensure every feature PR includes a test plan and coverage report (A)."

### üìä 2. **Performance Review**

> "In Q1 during our product launch (S), your detailed release checklist (I) helped catch several edge cases early (R). It gave the team confidence (C). Keep sharing similar playbooks before major launches (A)."

### üéØ 3. **Career Coaching**

> "During the design review (S), your ideas were great but not clearly structured (I), which made stakeholders confused (R). If this becomes a pattern (C), it could hinder your chances of taking lead roles. Let's work on your storytelling approach for technical communication (A)."

## üîÅ Why SIRCA Works

* Keeps **feedback objective**, not emotional.
* Focuses on **behavior**, not the person.
* Promotes **self-awareness** and **growth**.
* Ideal for **bi-directional feedback** (manager ‚Üî report, peer ‚Üî peer).

## ‚úÖ SIRCA vs. SBI (Another common model)

| Model                                                       | Additions in SIRCA                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| SBI: Situation, Behavior, Impact                            | Simple but doesn't suggest next steps       |
| **SIRCA**: Situation, Impact, Reaction, Consequence, Action | More robust, forward-looking, drives change |
