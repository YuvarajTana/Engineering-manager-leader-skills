The **SMART model** is a goal-setting framework used in coaching, management, and personal development to ensure that objectives are **clear, realistic, and achievable**. It‚Äôs a practical tool for guiding conversations during 1:1s, reviews, or OKR planning.

## ‚úÖ **SMART Model Explained**

Each goal should be:

| Letter | Stands for | Description                                                |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S**  | Specific   | The goal should be clear and unambiguous.                  |
| **M**  | Measurable | You should be able to quantify progress or success.        |
| **A**  | Achievable | The goal must be realistic given the resources and skills. |
| **R**  | Relevant   | It must align with broader team or personal objectives.    |
| **T**  | Time-bound | The goal must have a deadline or timeframe.                |

## üìå Example in an Engineering Context

**Weak goal:**
*"Improve API performance."*

**SMART goal:**
*"Reduce the average response time of the `/orders` API endpoint from 600ms to under 200ms by July 31st, by implementing caching and optimizing DB queries."*

| SMART Component | Example Mapping                              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **S**           | Focused on `/orders` API                     |
| **M**           | From 600ms to 200ms                          |
| **A**           | Feasible with caching and query optimization |
| **R**           | Relevant to performance KPIs                 |
| **T**           | By July 31st                                 |

## üß† How to Use SMART as a Manager

1. **During 1:1s:**
   ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs one SMART goal you want to achieve this sprint or quarter?‚Äù

2. **For Growth Plans:**
   When helping a junior dev grow, shift vague goals into SMART goals:
   *"I want to become better at system design"* ‚Üí
   *"Design and document the architecture for the new Notification Service by end of Q2."*

3. **In Performance Reviews:**
   Set SMART goals as action items for underperformers. Track progress quarterly.

4. **For Team OKRs:**
   Convert vague aspirations into measurable outcomes:
   *‚ÄúImprove code quality‚Äù* ‚Üí *‚ÄúReach 90% code coverage and reduce critical bugs to < 5 per release by Q3.‚Äù*

## üéØ Pro Tip

Combine **SMART** with the **GROW model** for coaching:

* Use GROW to **understand** what they want.
* Use SMART to **define** what they‚Äôll do about it.
